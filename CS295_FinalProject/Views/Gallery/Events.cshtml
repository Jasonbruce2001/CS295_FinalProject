            <h3>Christmas Gift Exchange</h3>
            <p style="text-indent: 2vw;">
                Join us for a festive Christmas Gift Exchange at Eugene Fine Art! Celebrate the season of giving with fellow art 
                enthusiasts in a cozy, creative atmosphere. To participate, first come in store before the 19th and fill out a 
                gift list. Next you will receive the list of another participant, and choose items off their list to buy ($15 minimum). 
                On the 19th, we will hold the exchange in our gallery from 6-8pm. Light refreshments and seasonal treats will be 
                provided to make the evening even merrier. Donâ€™t miss this opportunity to spread holiday cheer and connect with your 
                local art community!
